## About
Welcome to the official Git repository for KVIrc themes.  
Share your KVIrc themes with your fellow users.

We are looking for theme authors to submit fresh new themes compatible with KVIrc **4.3.2** and to revamp existing themes and submit them back here.

### Theme submission

The themes should be in a **UNPACKED** form, the directories that
KVIrc produces by a simple *Save Theme* operation.

[Fork this repository](https://github.com/kvirc/kvirc-themes/for/) and submit your theme(s) via a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### Licensing

All works submitted to KVIrc themes repository should contain an accompanying licence. 
Especially if your theme includes user made icons or artwork or that is sourced by you for inclusion. :boom:

As the author of the work, you have complete freedom to choose what licensing model which
best suits you and the works submitted.

We recommend [Open Source](http://opensource.org/licenses/category) compatible licences, and in the cases where you don't specify a licence,
you understand that the default **[GPLv2](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0)** licence is automatically applied to your submission once its merged.

:boom: If you are not the author of the icons or artwork included with your themes, please ensure you are respecting the authors copyright or any licensing terms and have permission to use and redistribute their works and include such licences with your submission.

### Inclusion of icons

Currently KVIrc *4.3.2* has a complete set of **[327 coresmall icons](https://github.com/kvirc/KVIrc/blob/ff1672c25c25a994d92ab44e6242ff85ba99f17f/src/kvirc/kernel/KviIconManager.h#L495)** plus **60** large icons.

By default the *Save Theme* operation will optionally copy the core icons into your theme's directory where none exist.

Themes without any icons will automatically use the default core icon set for KVIrc.  
We recommend this if you intend to use core icon set and automatically use any improved icons submitted to core.

Any specific icons you submit with your theme are automatically loaded preferentially over the **core** icons they intend to replace.
